                      Enterprise University is a learning platform designed to
                      digitize learning modules with diverse learning resources
                      to enhance the knowledge and skills of employees, while
                      also facilitating assessments. Unlike other learning
                      platforms, this platform is specifically tailored for
                      individuals within the company, including executives,
                      employees, and interns, allowing them to independently
                      manage and customize the content added to the platform,
                      ensuring that it aligns with the client&apos;s
                      preferences.

                      I have gained valuable lessons from this project, as it
                      marks my first &apos;major&apos; project as a full-time
                      UI/UX Designer at PT. Machine Vision Indonesia. It is
                      considered a significant project as I am the sole designer
                      working on it. Apart from my responsibilities as a
                      designer, I also assisted the PM in creating the User
                      Requirement Specification (URS) documentation and
                      supported the QC team during the testing process.

                      In addition to the additional responsibilities outside my
                      role as a designer, the biggest challenge of this project
                      was conducting research on the application flow,
                      particularly for the mentor and admin roles. Limited
                      access to research resources made it difficult for me to
                      determine the best flow for the users.

                      Most of the applications I tried only showcased the user
                      perspective, whereas in the Enterprise University
                      application, there are multiple roles involved such as
                      admin and mentor. Questions arose regarding how mentors
                      can create courses and quizzes, how admins can manage the
                      application, who has access to information in case the
                      company has subsidiaries, and how to handle courses
                      specific to certain employees, such as specific divisions
                      or levels.

                      Beyond design challenges, there were also issues with
                      other teams, such as developers facing difficulties in
                      implementing the design, resulting in several design
                      changes. Through the experiences gained from this project,
                      I learned a great deal about various aspects. This
                      includes creating documentation for clients, the research
                      process involved in product development, delivering
                      designs to developers, enhancing communication within the
                      team, and the importance of mutual support throughout the
                      lengthy process of application development.
