                      A smart warehouse is a technologically advanced facility
                      that incorporates automation to optimize inventory
                      management, and enhance overall efficiency. By leveraging
                      real-time data,smart warehouses can significantly improve
                      inventory accuracy and reduce operational costs

                      Smart Warehouse is a Warehouse Management System
                      application that serves to control various processes such
                      as shipping, receiving, and put away. It also aims to
                      monitor movements, picking, and manage stock of items. In
                      this case, the items referred to are spare parts (or
                      consumable goods) and tools (equipment to be returned to
                      the warehouse).

                      The main problem experienced by the client is the
                      discrepancy in stock. The difference between what is
                      recorded and what is actually present in the warehouse
                      often becomes an issue. The lack of proper system
                      recording makes tracking difficult. Non-returned tools and
                      excessive retrieval of spare parts also pose serious
                      problems as they frequently result in financial losses for
                      the company.

                      The user interview was the first step I took. During this

                      solve their problems. Additionally, I conducted competitor

                      If items already added to the cart, the operator will
                      proceed to check out the items. The supervisor will
                      receive a notification for approval of the item retrieval.
                      On the other hand, once the request is approved by the
                      supervisor, the storekeeper will receive a notification
                      regarding the operator&apos;s request. The storekeeper
                      will then retrieve the requested spare parts or tools from
                      the warehouse.

                      There are two types of transactions: Goods Purchased and
                      Tools Loaned. Goods Purchased refers to disposable spare
                      parts that do not need to be returned after retrieval,
                      while Tools Loaned involves borrowing tools that need to
                      be returned after use.

                      The research process is the most challenging aspect I
                      experienced when developing a manufacturing application.
                      Limited access to resources often makes it difficult for
                      me to design an application, determine which features to
                      include, and establish user flows. This project implements
                      a pre-existing design system, which speeds up the
                      application development process, especially on the Front
                      End.

                      Issues arise regarding frequently changing requirements
                      and numerous additional requests, while the project
                      manager is unable to filter the demands yet. This becomes
                      a constraint in the project execution.

                      However, through effective communication between the
                      designer, project manager, and client, these issues can be
                      resolved.

                      From this project, I learned the importance of a design
                      system in the application development process. I also
                      learned how to communicate with project managers and
                      clients to find win-win solutions.
